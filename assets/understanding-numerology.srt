Hello. I'm {{name}} with Expert Village.
And, we're talking today about numerology.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,120
And, today, I'm going to demonstrate to you
how to calculate your birth number. So, my

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,549
friend, {{name}}, popped in and offered to be the
subject for this demonstration. Hi, everybody.

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:20,769
Thank you, {{name}}. Thank you, Carmen. How are
you? Good. Good. So, {{name}} is going to tell

5
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:25,689
us what his birthday is and from that I'm
going to demonstrate to you how to calculate

6
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:32,689
his birth number. So, {{name}}, what is your birthday?
{{month}} {{day}}, {{year}}. Okay. So, I'm going to

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:43,290
show you how to do this. Okay. So, we have
{{month}} {{day}}, {{year}}. So, {{month}} is {{month}}, the

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,980
second month. We have {{day}}. And we have {{year}}.
So, how numerology works is you keep adding

9
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,070
together. So, 2, that's just one digit. {{day}}
is 2 plus 8. {{year}} is 1 plus 9 plus 5 plus

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,640
4. What do these equal? 2 is 2. 2 plus 8 equals
10. 1 plus 9 plus 5 plus 4. What does that

11
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:21,860
equal? 1 plus 9 is 10 plus 5 is 15 plus 4
is 19. 19. And, then we keep adding again.

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:30,620
We've got 2. We've got 10. And, we've got
19. 2 is 2. 10, 1 plus 0, 1. Okay. 1 plus

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,920
9. What's one plus nine? 10. Good. Thank you,
{{name}}. You're good at math. And then, okay,

14
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:51,510
we keep adding for the final time. We've got
2. We've got 1. 1 plus 0, what is that? One.

15
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,600
Excellent. So, now we have our final three
numbers. 2 plus 1 plus 1. And, that equals?

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Three. Four. Excuse me. I know that was a
deliberate mistake. Okay. So, 4. We have discovered

17
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,510
{{name}}'s life number, his birth date number.
And, that is 4.
